# Hello, My Name Is Daniel and i am an aspiring Frontend Developer.

I recently started learning React and it has been an amazing journey so far, I like to learn by creating so i decided to create this project.

# Getting Started
So there are quite a few capabilities of reacts used in this project from what i have learnt so far. This project helps me to understand the importancce of components and how they work.
1. React Components
2. React Router DOM

# The Project
A basic website with a Navbar component, Jumbotron component, About component, Contact component and a NoMatch component. These components all have corresponding routes url e.g localhost/3000/contact. each url takes you to the dedicated page and an invalid url e.g localhost/3000/ggahagsahsg will navigate to a page with a text "NO MATCH!!!"
